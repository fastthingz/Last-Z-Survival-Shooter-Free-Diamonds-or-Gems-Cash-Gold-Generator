Easy Ways to Beat Last Z: Survival Shooter
1. Prioritize Upgrading Key Buildings

Always keep your headquarters and essential buildings (like assaulter camp, suitor camp, resource buildings) upgrading. Many progression blocks require specific building levels, so plan upgrades ahead to avoid getting stuck.

Use the free 2-hour construction boost early on when upgrade times are short, or save it for longer upgrades later in the game.

2. Maximize Resource Gathering

Send as many troops as possible to resource points (wood, food, zent mines) and let them gather over time. Food is often harder to get, so prioritize farmland, especially before logging off for extended periods.

Build extra lumber yards and warehouses to increase both production and protection of resources, especially once your initial shield drops.

3. Research and Power Up Efficiently

Focus on maxing out research in the laboratory, especially in the "new home" section, to unlock troop promotions and buffs like faster training and better equipment.

Upgrade equipment and participate in events for chances at orange (high-tier) equipment and power cores.

4. Use Events and Arena for Rewards

Participate in building and alliance events, like "full preparedness" and "alliance duel," to earn points, resources, and equipment boxes.

Use the arena shop to buy orange equipment and power cores with medals. Save points for the most valuable rewards.

5. Recruit and Level Up Heroes

Recruit S-tier heroes for advanced battles and tough bosses. Level up your top five heroes for the best hero power and focus on their equipment.

Utilize the new long-press feature to level up heroes quickly, but time upgrades for events to maximize rewards.

6. Join a Strong Alliance

Engage in alliance rallies, especially with the new offline rally feature that lets your strongest troops auto-join while youâ€™re offline.

Take advantage of alliance rewards and the reduced damage requirements for events.

7. Use VIP and Parallel Upgrades

Increase your VIP level for benefits like faster construction, march speed, and hospital capacity.

Unlock and use parallel construction and research (e.g., via the new "rapid growth" research) to speed up progress.

Additional Tips
Always time your upgrades and hero level-ups with events for bonus rewards.

Max out shelter buildings to unlock the latest research and parallel upgrades.

Focus on building a balanced team of heroes and equip them with the best gear you can obtain from events and the arena.

Take advantage of new features like offline rally participation and portrait mode for convenience.

By following these strategies and staying updated with the latest improvements, you can progress efficiently and stand out in Last Z: Survival Shooter.
